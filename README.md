# Marketscope
Marketscope is a mock stock portfolio game where you can buy, sell and short U.S. stocks and see overall how much profit you've made or lost over time. The original idea is the premise that the user represents a hyptothetically "broke" Warren Buffet who only has a million dollars left in his fortune and it's up to you (the user) to see how he can make it all back.

### Planning & Design
I knew this would have to be a full stack app in order to monitor and save each user trade and the current profit and loss math behind each held stock in the portfolio. I decided to use Mongoose and Express for the backend and React for the front end. 


#### Tech Used in this Project:
* Node
* Express
* React
* Axios
* Promises
* AJAX
* MLab (Mongoose DB GUI)
* Third-Party API (IEX Stock Exchange)

#### Design:
For the initial wireframe and UI design, I've used AdobeXD to get a solid visualization of the overall layout, colors and feel of the app before starting to get into the actual coding and development process. I decided to go with a 3 column dashboard layout for desktop and laptop sizes which is fully responsive at the lower screen sizes.
